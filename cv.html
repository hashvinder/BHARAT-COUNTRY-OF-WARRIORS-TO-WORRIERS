    <P>PEOPLE WHO FORGET THEIR OWN HISTORY IS ALWAYS FORGOTTEN IN THIS WORLD‚Äù BY SAYING THIS QUOTES YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE SHOWN AS WEAK IN OTHER COUNTRIES. WE NEVER RESPECTED WHAT OUR ANSCETORS DONE AND LEFT FOR US<b> SARDAR JASSA SINGH AHUWALIA THE SIKH WARRIOR ONLY THE PERSON ON WHO STOPED AHMEHD AHAH ABDALI (KING OF AFGAN). WHO DEFEATED MUGHAS 19 TIME IN THEIR OWN CAPITAL i.e. DELHI, ALSO THE STORY OF 12 BAJE HAS A GREAT RELATION WITH HIM.</b></P>
<h2>HIS EARLY AGE </h2>
<P>SARDAR JASSA SINGH AHUWALIA WAS BORN ON 3 MAY 1718 IN LAHORE. HIS FATHER SARDAR BADAR SINGH TOOK PART IN MANY BATTELS WITH SHRI GURU GOBIND SINGH JI. HE WAS MATRY WHEN SARADAR JI WAS ONLY 4 YEAR. HIS MOTHER JOINED HIM IN KHALSA COMMMUNITY, TAUGHT HIM HISTORY OF GURUS AND SPIRIT TO FAUGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE. WHEN HE WAS JUST 12 YEAR HE WAS SENT TO JUNGEL WITH NAWAB KAPPOR SINGH JI FOR LEARING MOR ABOUT KHALSA PANT. YOU MUST BE THINKING WHEN SIKHS WERE LIVING IN FOREST AND DOES NOT EVEN HAVE AN ACER OF LAND TO CALL THEIRS, HOW THEIR LEADER CAN ADD NAWAB IN FRONT OF HIS NAME. BELIEVE ME THERE IS GREAT HISTORY BEHIND THIS.
</P>
<h2>ENTRY OF MARATHAS 
</h2>
<p>ACCORDING TO ME MARTHAS AND SIKHS ARE THE BACKBONE OF INDEPENDENT COUNRTY. THEIR SPIRIT OF FIGHTING AGAINST INJUSTICE CAN NEVER BE COVERED IN WORDS. BRINGING BACK TO TOPIC AFTER THE INVASION OF NADIR SHAH THE MARTHAS GOT THE CHANCE TO DEFEAT THE MUGHALS AS THERE IS NO PROPER LEADERSHIP IN MUGHAL EMPIRE. IN THE LEARDERSHIP OF PESHWA RAGHUNATH RAO MARTHAS ENTERD THE PANJAB. WHILE FIGHTING SO MANY WARS AND HAVING CONTINIOUS VICTORY THE BEHAVIOURS OF PERSON TURNS AGGRESSIVE, THIS CAN BE SAID AS MISTAKE OF MARATHAS AS THEY BECOME FROM SAVIOURS TO CONQURERS. WHEN RAGHUNAT RAO ATTACKED THE PUNJAB SARDARNI SAHIB KAUR PATIALA WAS READY WITH HIS FORCES. THIS BATTLE LEAD TO HEAVY LOSS OF MARATHAS AND THEY WERE READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH SIKHS. SIKHS RESPECTED THE ALLY WITH MARATHAS AND GAVE THEM HONOUR FOR ALL THEIR VICTORY. SOME SOURCES ALSO SAYS THAT NEAR HARMANDIR SAHIB BOTH EXCHANGE THEIR TURBANS AND BECOME THE BROTHERS. BOTH FORCES PLAN TO ATTACK ON AGHANS WHO CAME WITH INTENSION TO LOOT HINDUS AND SIKHS. IN YEAR 1759 THE COMBINED FORCES OF BOTH SIKHS AND MARTHAS MARCHED TOWARS AREA CONQURED BY AFGANS AND THROW THEM IN OUTSKIRTS OF PANJAB. SIKHS THAUGHT THAT THE MARTAHS WILL HELD THE POWER TO THEM BUT THEY GAVE THE POWER TO ADINA BEGH, WHO WAS A MUGHAL. THIS CAN BE SAID AS A BIG BLUNDER FOR MARTHA EMIPRE. ADINA BEG STARTS ATTACKING ON SIKHS. SARDAR JASSA SINGH WROTE MANY LETTER TO RAGHUNATH RAO AND MARTHA EMIPE FOR THIS BUT NONE OF THEM WERE ANSWERD. ADINA BEG DIED WITH AN HEART ATTACK AND WITH THIS SIKHS NEVER TRUSTED MARTHAS AGAIN .

<h2>ATTACK ON MARATHA EMPIRE
</h2>
<p>MARATHAS REACHED TO ATTAOK FORT WHICH WAS A BORDER BETWEEN MUGHALS AND AFGANS FOR CENTURIES. MARATHAS WAS AWARE ABOUT THE SITUATION OF AFAGHNAS AND THEIR HATERED FOR THEM, BUT THEY TOOK IT LIGHTLY. SOON THE STROMS RAISED IN KABUL AND KANDHAR IN THE FACE OF AHMEDH SHAH ABDALI. ABDALI CAN BE SAID AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND STRONGEST AND SMARTEST ENEMY OF OUR COUNTRY. WHY? BEACAUSE OF HIS STRATEGIES. IN ISLAM, THERE IS A BELIVE THAT IN THE WORLD THEIR 40 LEADERS ALWAYS PRESENT TO PROTECT AND GIVE A DIRECTION TO THEIR RELEGION THEY ARE KNOWN AS ABDAL SO TO GET FULL SUPPORT OF HIS PEOPLE HE GAVE HIM NAME AS AHMED SHAH ABDALI, ALSO INCLUDING THE FACT THAT HE TOOK MANY KINGS OF BHARAT IN HIS SIDE FOR THE WAR WHICH BECOME ONE OF THE MAJOR REASON FOR HIS VICTORY. SARDAR JASSA SINGH AHUWALIA AND OTHER SIKH LEADERS MADE A DESCION OF NOT PARTICIPATING IN THIS WAR BECAUSE OF PAST EXPERINCE.
